Press+hold battery button to turn on.  router will turn on but not computer.  press computer power button on chassis to get computer up.
IPs: 10.10.1.1 router 10.10.1.2 computer

Network credentials on chassis said uname/pw=hebirobot/hebi1234, but that didn't work.  hebi/hebi1234 worked.  Actually, hebirobot was the computer name, not the username.

if you "sudo shutdown -h now," the red power button on chassis will soon turn off.  Then you can turn off battery.

Setting up MobileIO:

install app from app store

startup the battery, computer, and actuators

ssh onto computer, launch python, and do:

>>> import hebi
matplotlib not found - hebi.util.plot_logs and hebi.util.plot_trajectory will not work.
pynput not found - HebiKeyboard will not work
>>> lookup = hebi.Lookup()
>>> lookup

This will show you the family (for Rosie it was "Rosie").

Connect to the network name of the robot (sticker on top or bottom of chassis) from your mobile device.

In the settings of the app, update the Family field and press "update".  It will automatically launch the demo.

On iPhone, the app layout is too constrained and you can't actually touch the "translate" button for the mobile base.  Needs an iPad.  Press the X button to end the demo.  It will automatically restart after several seconds unless you change the Family name back to something different.
